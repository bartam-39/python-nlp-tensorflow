# Python Natural Language Processing with Tensorflow

This repository use Tensorflow to implement some of the most popular NLP algorithms.
Additionally, we run the application inside a Docker container. This is not mandatory, you can use python venv instead.
If you like to run the code in a container you need the following:
- docker installed in your local machine,
- vscode extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers installed in your vscode, to boot the devcontainers.

Otherwise, you simply need to create a venv and then pip install the requirements.txt file.
